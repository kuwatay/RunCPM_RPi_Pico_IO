# RunCPM_RPo_Pico + IO port emulation

This program is a fork of RunCPM_RPo_Pico

 ![RunCPM_RPo_Pico](https://github.com/guidol70/RunCPM_RPi_Pico)

This repository provides a program that extends I/O port emulation for RunCPMRPoPico. By using the extended functionality provided in this repository, you can directly control GPIOs through Z80 I/O instructions, making it easy to perform external control operations.

For parts outside the extension, please refer to the original repository.

Specifically, two 8-bit ports have been added, which can be directly accessed by the Z80 CPU using I/O instructions.

## Address Mapping
Ports are mapped Z80 IO address as follows;

```
PORT A
	I/O register: $4
	Ddata Direction Register : $5
	Pull-Up Register: $6
	
PORT B
	I/O register: $0
	Ddata Direction Register : $1
	Pull-Up Register: $2
```
Each pin (bit) of the port can be individually configured as either an input or an output.ã€€The default configuration of port pins is set to input.

To set the port pin as an output, it is necessary to write a 1 to the corresponding bit in the DDR (Data Direction Register).To set it as an input, you need to write a 0 to the corresponding bit in the DDR. 

When a pin is configured as an output, the value set in the I/O register is output to the corresponding GPIO.
When the pin is configured as an input, the value of the corresponding GPIO can be read.

Similarly, to enable the pull-up on a port pin, you need to write a 1 to the corresponding bit in the PUR (Pull-Up Register).The Pull-Up Register is only effective when the pin is configured as an input.

The DDR and PUR can also be read to retrieve the values that have been set

## GPIO Mappinng
The port corresponds to the physical GPIOs as follows.

```
PORT A
	A0-A7: GPIO2-GPIO9
	
PORT B
	B0-B5: GPIO10-GPIO15
	B6-B7: GPIO20-GPIO21
	
```

By modifying the definitions in the source code, you can assign available GPIOs to achieve a different pin configuration.

## Example
Using the MS Basic included with RunCPM at the A drive, you can easily control I/O ports. 

The following program sets PORT A as output and sequentially outputs values from 0 to 255.

```
10 OUT 5,255
20 FOR I=0 TO 255
30  OUT 4,I
40  FOR J=0 TO 1000
50  NEXT J
60 NEXT I
```
